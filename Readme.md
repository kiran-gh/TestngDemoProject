Automation Project README

Project Name: NxtTrenz

Project Overview:
NxtTrenz is a demo application that simulates an online store experience. Upon logging in with 
valid credentials, users are directed to the home page, where they are greeted with a welcome 
message and a "Shop Now" button. The application features navigation buttons that enable users 
to access various pages, including the Products page and Cart page, as well as return to the Home
page. Once users have completed their desired actions, they can simply log out of the application
by clicking the logout button. This summarizes the overall workflow of the NxtTrenz application.
